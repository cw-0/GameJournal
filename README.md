## Tracking Your Games Better == Clearing Your Backlog
A simple Python application that allows you to track your video games, update their completion status, and leave reviews. The app uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, with data stored in a config.ini file.

### Features
- Track Games: Add games and categorize them as "In Progress", "Incomplete", or "Completed".
- Status Update: Change the status of the games as you progress through them.
- Reviews: Leave a review for each game you track.
